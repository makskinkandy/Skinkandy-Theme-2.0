Change pillowcases regularly. For piercings in tight spaces (such as rooks, forward helix), we recommend the use of a handheld electric fan to dry the area thoroughly. Excess moisture promotes bacterial growth and creates an environment that hinders healing. Avoid ear plugs for the duration of healing where they might interfere with the piercing (eg. tragus and daith). Swelling (and sometimes bleeding or bruising) can be expected. Healing time can take up to 6-12 months, but can usually be changed to slightly shorter, sterile jewellery from 6-8weeks.

Get a new toothbrush to reduce bacteria exposure. Stick to your usual dental hygiene routine, but avoid excessive cleaning, as it can increase the risk of oral thrush. If you use mouthwash, make sure it’s alcohol-free. Avoid consuming dairy, excessive sugar, spicy food, alcohol, and cigarettes for the first 2 weeks. Keep makeup, cleansers, and moisturisers away from the piercing. Avoid swimming or soaking in water, and rinse thoroughly after showers. Downsize your initial piercing jewellery as recommended by your piercer to prevent dental damage. Healing typically takes 4–6 months, but jewellery changes can be made after 6–8 weeks if necessary.

Clean daily with aftercare solution and do not remove the jewellery. Avoid soaking in any bodies of water (including ocean and pool) and rinse thoroughly after washing in the shower. For piercings in tight spaces such as navel, we recommend the use of a handheld electric fan to dry the area thoroughly. Excess moisture promotes bacterial growth and creates an environment that hinders healing. Avoid tight clothing for the duration of healing. Swelling (and sometimes bleeding or bruising) can be expected. Healing time can take up to 6-12 months, but can usually be changed to slightly shorter, sterile jewellery from 6-8 weeks.
