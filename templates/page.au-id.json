If you are over 16 but look under the age of 25 you WILL be asked to provide ID that confirms your NAME, DOB and PHOTO.<br/><br/>This can be either be one form of ID showing your Name, DOB and Photo OR 2 forms of ID which confirm these requirements (eg: a formal school ID that shows Name and Photo AND a birth certificate that shows matching Name and DOB).</p><h2>Restricted 18+ Piercings:</h2><p>A single form of approved PHOTO ID must be presented for 18+ Restricted Piercings.

Our staff need to be reasonably satisfied that there is a genuine parental relationship between yourself and the child being pierced, and will therefore ask to see ID and a form of proof of guardianship.<br/><br/>The easiest way to help verify your parental relationship is to provide a Medicare Card or birth certificate with the names of both the parent/guardian and the person being pierced on the same card (or on separate cards with the same Medicare number), or log into your Medicare, Centrelink or Mygov app showing all names linked to the same account.<br/><br/>If you are a legal guardian or legal carer you may be asked to show a guardianship order, Centrelink documentation or Centrelink App showing both names linked.<br/><br/>Written approval is required from the Department of Childrens Services for any piercing procedures to be performed on foster children.</p><p><a href=\"https://support.skinkandy.com/s/booking-form\" target=\"_blank\">BOOK A PIERCING NOW</a></p>"
