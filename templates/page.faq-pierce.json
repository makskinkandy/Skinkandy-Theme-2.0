Each member of our SkinKandy Squad must earn a nationally accredited infection control certificate before they can pierce independently. While this certificate isn't required in some states, we believe in raising the bar for all our team members. Once they've got their certification and fully understand our high standards and values, they go through an extensive in-house training program. Under the supervision of senior piercers, they perfect their technique at their own pace, ensuring they are confident and capable before they pierce unsupervised.<br/><br/></p>"

Remember, cheap isn’t always better! We recommend using internally threaded, implant-grade titanium jewellery – your body will thank you for it! Also, consider your lifestyle (sports, pets, headphones, diet) before making your choice. It's important your piercing gets the best possible start in life.</p>"

This ensures your body has the best change at healing your new piercings and helps minimise the risk of adverse reactions. This will depend on your anatomy, the position of the piercings, and previous healing experiences. Multiple piercings in a small area may increase the chance of excessive swelling, and as such may be limited to 2 or 3 in one sitting. Please discuss options with one of our professional piercers prior to your appointment.</p>"
