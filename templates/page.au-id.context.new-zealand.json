Our staff need to be reasonably satisfied that there is a genuine parental relationship between yourself and the child being pierced, and will therefore ask to see ID and verbal confirmation from the child.</p><h2>Does a parent / guardian need to be present?</h2><p>We understand that as a busy parent it can sometimes be difficult to find the time to accompany your child to their piercing appointment. There may be instances where it’s acceptable for your child to be accompanied by another responsible adult if you are unable to attend the appointment in person - here’s what’s required:<br/><br/> Written consent is allowable. Written consent can be arranged by completing and returning our consent form in advance and providing copies of the relevant ID for the child and parent/guardian. </p><h2>What ID do I need as a parent or guardian?</h2><p>You will need to provide photo ID. This can be either be one form of ID showing your Name, DOB and Photo OR 2 forms of ID which confirm these requirements (eg: a formal school ID that shows Name and Photo AND a birth certificate that shows matching Name and DOB).
