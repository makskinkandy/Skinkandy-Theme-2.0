Stick to your routine, and you’ll be on your way to a healthy piercing!<\/p>"}},"question_RNqz9k":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What is downsizing and why is it important?","answer":"<p>Downsizing refers to changing your jewellery to a sterile shorter piece once the initial swelling has gone down. If you leave the longer jewellery in place for too long, it can cause irritation and affect healing. Most piercings can be downsized after 6-8 weeks, but we recommend you do so with a professional piercer’s help to ensure it’s done properly.<\/p>"}},"question_ihWjML":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How long should I wait before downsizing my jewellery?","answer":"<p>We recommend waiting at least 6-8 weeks before downsizing your jewellery to a shorter, sterile piece. We prefer that you come back for a free check-up so we can assess your piercing and even change the jewellery for you. Don’t rush the process – it's important not to downsize too quickly or change jewellery before your piercing is fully healed.<\/p>"}},"question_wnkhTg":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Can I go swimming with my new piercing?","answer":"<p>We strongly recommend avoiding swimming (in pools, oceans, lakes) until your piercing is fully healed. Bodies of water can contain bacteria that may cause infections. If swimming is a must, apply a waterproof dressing over the piercing, but be sure it seals properly to keep water out. Always remove the dressing as soon as you’re done swimming.<\/p>"}},"question_XqLMCG":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"I think my piercing is infected. What should I do?","answer":"<p>While we follow the highest infection control standards, your role in aftercare is crucial. It’s normal for a new piercing to be slightly red, swollen, or sore in the first few weeks. However, if you suspect infection, don’t remove the jewellery – this can lead to an abscess. Visit a doctor immediately for proper treatment, and come to SkinKandy for a free check-up so we can offer advice.<\/p>"}},"question_RhYm7h":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"I have a bump on my piercing. What should I do?","answer":"<p>A bump is often a sign of irritation or healing. The best thing to do is assess the cause – is it the placement, the quality of jewellery, or accidental bumps? If you’re unsure, visit us for a free check-up so our professional piercers can advise you on next steps.<\/p>"}},"question_eX34Nj":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Are “crusties” a bad sign on a new piercing, even if I clean it regularly?","answer":"<p>No need to worry! Crusty build-up is completely normal as part of the healing process. Think of it like scabbing over a cut – it’s your body’s way of protecting the wound. However, if the crust changes colour or becomes excessive, it’s worth checking in with us.<\/p>"}},"question_t4HWyY":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"All my piercings end up infected, irritated or rejecting. Should I keep trying?","answer":"<p>We understand your frustration. It’s important to differentiate between an infection, irritation, or a piercing that’s not fully healed. If you suspect infection, see a doctor right away. Otherwise, it may be due to poor jewellery quality, piercing placement, or aftercare. If none of those are issues, patience is key – healing takes time, and everyone's body reacts differently. Lifestyle factors like sports, pets, or diet can affect healing too.<\/p>"}},"question_Vme9x4":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How Should I Care for My Lobe Piercings?","answer":"<p>- Avoid touching your piercing and never sleep on it.
