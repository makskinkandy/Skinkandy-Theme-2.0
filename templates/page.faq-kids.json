If the lobes are too small, it can be difficult to place the piercings correctly, which may cause the piercings to move or migrate as the lobes grow. Improper placement can also make the jewellery sit uncomfortably and slow the healing process. If we determine the earlobes are too small, we will advise waiting a little longer.</p>"

Titanium is also hypoallergenic and free of nickel, which promotes faster healing. We have a large variety of options in-store, and our SkinKandy Squad will help you choose the best piece for your child.</p>"

We don’t open the jewellery from the sterile package until we’re ready to proceed, and we’ll always check with your child to ensure they are comfortable and happy to go ahead. If they change their mind before the earrings are opened, no worries at all!</p>"
