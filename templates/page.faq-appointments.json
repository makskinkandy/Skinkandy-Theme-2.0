A sugary drink and a salty snack are a good idea to bring along, just in case! Don’t forget your photo ID (required in most cases). All clients must complete a consent form and address any pre-existing conditions or medications that may affect your ability to get pierced. Arriving 10 minutes early is a good idea to get these details sorted. It’s also helpful to think about your piercing location (e.g., belly button) and choose clothing accordingly.</p>"

All equipment is sterile and single-use, and after the piercing is done, you’ll see that perfect result – and your once anxious face will turn into a big smile! Before you leave, we’ll go over aftercare instructions so you know exactly how to care for your new piercing.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>The effectiveness of numbing spray or cream during a piercing procedure is questionable, as it typically only numbs the first few layers of skin. Some piercers believe numbing agents containing lidocaine may change the skin’s tension, potentially affecting how the piercing sits once the spray or cream wears off.<br/><br/>While it’s not something we actively promote or use in-store, choosing to use a numbing agent before you arrive is a personal decision. Please inform your piercer if you have applied a numbing agent before your procedure.</p>"

Here are the requirements:<br/><br/><strong>Lobe Piercings with Cartridge (Ages 6 months - 15 years):</strong> - A parent or legal guardian must consent to the procedure.<br/>- The parent or legal guardian must provide photo ID and proof of guardianship.<br/><br/><strong>Standard (Needle) Piercings (Ages 5 - 15 years; 5-17 years in WA):</strong>- ID confirming your name and DOB (e.g., birth certificate, formal school ID, Medicare app).<br/>- A parent or legal guardian must consent and provide photo ID and proof of guardianship.<br/><br/><strong>All Piercings (Ages 16 years and over; 18 years in WA):</strong>- ID confirming your name, DOB, and photo (e.g., driver's licence, passport).<br/><br/>Restricted 18+ Piercings:<br/>- A single form of approved photo ID is required.<br/><br/>For more details, <a href=\"https://skinkandy.com/pages/piercing-age-id-and-consent\" target=\"_self\">visit our ID page</a>.<br/><br/></p>"

However, it’s not always appropriate to have them in the clinic with you during a piercing.<br/><br/>We’d like to have your undivided attention and you need to have ours. Any kind of distraction can quickly become a hazard and we don’t want anything to compromise your safety (or ours!). So, if you have little ones that need supervision, please either bring someone along to watch them during your procedure or come on your own – what a perfect excuse for some “you” time!</p>"

            "answer": "<p>We can't pierce anyone who’s pregnant due to the higher risk of infection. Your body is busy growing and caring for new life, which can impact how well a piercing heals. After giving birth, your body needs time to recover and focus on your little one. We recommend waiting at least 3 months after giving birth if you’re not breastfeeding, or 6 months if you are, before getting a piercing.</p>"

In some cases, a medical certificate is required before proceeding. It’s our duty of care to ensure we are doing what’s right for you and we will never do anything to compromise your safety.
